Their marriage lasted from 1995 to 2001.</p><p>Following the divorce, rumors began circulating that Palmade was gay, due to which his marriage ended.</p><p>Years later, Palmade came out as gay and confirmed it in an <a href=# rel=noopener>interview</a> in Tetu magazine.&nbsp;</p><p>He said he had relationships with several women but is looking for a serious relationship with a man.</p><p>Also On Genius Celebs: <a href=# rel=noopener>Shawn Kelce Girlfriend: Is Travis Kelce Brother In A Relationship? Family And Ethnicity</a></p><h2>Pierre Palmade Car Accident</h2><p>A traffic collision that occurred last Friday in Seine-et-Marne has garnered media attention, as actor Pierre Palmade was involved in the crash.</p><p>The accident occurred on February 10, 2023, at around 7 p.m. on the RD372 in the Villiers-en-Bière town in Seine-et-Marne, near Dammarie-les-Lys.</p><p>Pierre Palmade’s car accident left five injured, three in severe condition. The circumstances of the collision were not specified.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-13-at-13.32.33.png><p>The French actor reportedly hit another car (a Renault Mégane), traveling on the other lane head-on with his car (a Peugeot 3008).</p><p>Moments later, the vehicles were hit by another car driven by an old man.</p><p>The Renault carried a pregnant woman in her thirties, her six-year-old son, her brother-in-law in his forties, and the vehicle driver.</p><p>The actor was taken to the Kremlin-Bicêtre’s hospital and was in critical condition but is currently <a href=# rel=noopener>out of danger</a>.</p><p>The pregnant woman was airlifted to the Beaujon hospital in Clichy, and the child was taken to the Necker Hospital.</p><p>The driver of the third vehicle was transported to the South Ile-de-France hospital in Melun.</p><p>The woman, seven months pregnant, suffered a miscarriage due to the trauma caused by the crash.</p><p>It was later announced that the woman was out of danger, but the other three were in critical condition.</p><p>Two men in Pierre’s car were seen fleeing the scene as soon as the accident occurred. Their identities have not been uncovered.</p><h2>Pierre Palmade Cocaine Overdose Possibly Caused The Accident</h2><p>An initial investigation after the crash concluded that a cocaine overdose possibly caused French actor Pierre Palmade’s car accident.</p><p>Toxicology reports showed that Palmade was driving under the influence of cocaine.</p><p>The drugs and fear of getting arrested may be why the other two passengers in his cars fled the scene.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/geniuscelebs.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Screenshot-2023-02-13-at-13.35.19.png><p>As soon as his condition improves, Palmade is set to be tried for possible manslaughter.</p><p>According to French law, a driver with narcotics in his system can be charged with up to two years in jail.&nbsp;</p><p>Since Palmade tested positive for cocaine and injured other people, he is expected to face a prison sentence.</p><p>The 55 years old was previously charged with drug usage several times.&nbsp;</p><p>In 1995, he was convicted of cocaine usage and subsequently fined 20000 francs.</p><p>In 2019, Pierre publicly admitted that he suffered from addiction, saying that coke had ruined his life since his early 20s.</p><p>More By The Author: <a href=# rel=noopener>What Is Wrong With Kadarius Toney Teeth?
