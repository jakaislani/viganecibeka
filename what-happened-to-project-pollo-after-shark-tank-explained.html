He presented the captivating story of his business concept and invited the investors to help him make it a nationwide phenomenon. The vegan fast food brand’s rapid growth in the plant-based sector and the deal on offer from Bradbury elicited an astonishing reaction from the Sharks.</p>Recommended Videos<h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-project-pollo-s-shark-tank-pitch data-injectable=false>Project Pollo’s Shark Tank pitch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sharktankus-lucasbradbury-lukasbradbury.png><p data-characters=543 data-current-count=843 data-injectable=true>Lucas Bradbury appeared on&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 13, Episode 24</a>&nbsp;of the award-winning reality TV show. He pitched what he described as “America’s first vegan chicken fast food chain.” His business concept was to “free the chickens” by selling tasty, healthy poultry alternatives at reasonable prices to help people transition to a plant-based diet. The unique selling point of Project Pollo prices was great taste at an affordable cost, so people in all income classes could enjoy the option of a meat-free alternative.</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>Project Pollo’s core ingredient was breaded soy patties with a yummy chicken taste. Bradbury started selling sandwiches, wraps, salads, and buffalo macaroni with vegan cheese from a food truck in Austin, Texas and soon expanded to physical restaurants. During his appearance on Shark Tank, he proudly informed the panel that the company was launching its eleventh and twelfth locations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>The Sharks’ Analysis of Project Pollo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/sharktank-projectpollo.png><p data-characters=348 data-current-count=348 data-injectable=false>After a compelling pitch and successful taste test, Bradbury made an audacious proposal to the sharks: $2.5 million for 5 percent equity based on a $50 million valuation. The savvy sharks balked at the bid, expressing concerns about the high-octane growth rate of Project Pollo, the paltry stake on offer, and what struck them as an inflated value.</p><p data-characters=214 data-current-count=562 data-injectable=true>Kevin O’Leary immediately took issue with Project Pollo’s $50 million valuation. However, the multi-millionaire conceded that the products were the most delicious vegan fried chicken he had ever tasted.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>Bradbury explained that a combination of bootstrapping and a $1.75 million round of funding from a prior investor helped the company earn $3 million in sales from eight locations in its eight existing locations. He explained that he signed 10-year leases for Project Pollo’s locations as a sweetheart deal during the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>Real estate mogul and venture capitalist Barbara Corcoran took issue with the branding. In her opinion, the name Project Pollo suggested that its products were made of poultry and could diminish customer trust.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=269 data-injectable=false>The Sharks looked troubled when they expressed concern over Project Pollo’s rapid expansion, with guest Shark Kevin Hart wondering how Bradbury secured real estate deals and properly onboard a team so quickly. Bradbury fired back, “I thrive in chaos.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Did Project Pollo get a deal on Shark Tank?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kevinhart-sharktank.png><p data-characters=783 data-current-count=783 data-injectable=true>The fast and furious nature of Project Pollo rubbed the Sharks the wrong way. A combination of its fast and furious growth and the astronomical investment Bradbury was requesting caused a domino effect. Kevin O’Leary was the first to bow out because the current profits failed to justify Bradbury’s valuation. Billionaire Mark Cuban did not think Project Pollo was a sufficiently healthy alternative and followed suit. Kevin Hart was alarmed by the topsy-turvy nature of the venture and declined Bradbury’s offer. Corcoran was the next to exit, pointing out the similarities between Project&nbsp;Pollo and Tom and Chee. Lori Greiner, the Queen of QVC, compared Project Pollo to a “cyclone” and became the final Shark to turn down Bradbury’s offer.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Post-Shark Tank Developments</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/project-pollo-lucas-bradbury.png><p data-characters=220 data-current-count=520 data-injectable=true>Bradbury was not discouraged by the outcome of his appearance on&nbsp;Shark Tank. He&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">achieved his goal of taking his business nationwide</a>, opening five new Project Pollo locations, and acquiring two more food trucks.</p><p data-characters=295 data-current-count=295 data-injectable=false>Bradbury took to Instagram to share some of the challenges Project Pollo faced, specifically how inflation impacted its ability to stay true to its unique selling point of quality vegan poultry at affordable prices. He admitted that the company was ill-prepared to operate at the national level.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=595 data-injectable=true><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Project Pollo (@project_pollo)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=303 data-current-count=303 data-injectable=false>Project Pollo explored partnerships with Uber Eats, Grub Hub, and DoorDash. It also made deals with supermarkets to sell frozen versions of its breaded patties. However, none of the underlying issues in the business were addressed and solved. Project Pollo sold its leases and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">closed in early 2023</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Lessons from Project Pollo</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/project-pollo-shark-tank-2023.png><p data-characters=358 data-current-count=358 data-injectable=false>Sadly, Barbara Corcoran’s critique turned out to be spot on. Its fast growth and lack of infrastructure made it unsustainable in the long run. There is a reason why Shark Tank is considered one of&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 10 Best Reality TV Shows of All Time</a>. Its rapid expansion compromised its business strategy, which became increasingly disorganized and haphazard.</p><p data-characters=269 data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true>An introspective Bradbury regretted the lack of research and strategy in location selection for Project Pollo. Another pitfall for the business was its failure to focus on team development. He shared the following review of the experience with the Antonio Express-News:</p><p>“We made a lot of mistakes. We did things a little too fast in the beginning. Instead of focusing on speed, we should have focused on quality. That means not only in terms of product but in terms of team as well.”</p><p data-characters=122 data-current-count=350 data-injectable=false>In February 2023, Bradbury launched a new brand called Side Chicks, which serves poultry versions of Project Pollo dishes.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading data-injectable=false>Summary</h2><p data-characters=255 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Ultimately, a messy market entry, overambitious scaling, inefficient operations, a lack of understanding of its target demographics, and failure to develop its human resources brought about the downfall of Project Pollo even though its product was superb.</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Project Pollo’s story might have ended very differently had its charismatic CEO placed more value on the expertise and experience having a Shark on board would have brought to the enterprise. However, Brandbury’s overconfidence in his vision and unwillingness to take in the constructive criticism he received from the Sharks doomed America’s first vegan chicken fast-food chain.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>However, the trajectory of Project Pollo is a teaching moment for all aspiring entrepreneurs.
