In May 2009, she was appointed by President Barack Obama and Sworn in on 8 August 2009. She was the first Hispanic and Latina Supreme Court justice in U.S. history. She is the 111th associate Supreme Court justice and the third woman to join the court.</strong></p><p>Sotomayor became a U.S. District Court Judge in 1992 and was elevated to the U.S. Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1998. In May 2009, she was appointed by President Barack Obama as an associate Justice of the Supreme Court.</p><p>For Sonia Sotomayor, it was a childhood curiosity to be a judge, in any capacity. Yet she surpassed her own ambitions even as a lifelong overachiever by being the third woman and the first Hispanic justice to be appointed to the Supreme Court. That’s even more impressive when considering the Court has been around for 229 years.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-age></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Age</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sotomayor is 66 years old as of 2020. She was born Sonia Maria Sotomayor on June 25, 1954, in <span class="LrzXr kno-fv">The Bronx, New York, United States of America. She celebrates her birthday on June 25th every year. She is nicknamed The Wise Latina.</span></p><p>Sotomayor was raised a Catholic&nbsp;and grew up in Puerto Rican communities in the&nbsp;South Bronx&nbsp;and&nbsp;East Bronx; she self-identifies as a “Nuyorican”.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-height></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Height</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sotomayor stands at an <strong>average height</strong>&nbsp;and has&nbsp;<strong>moderate weight</strong>. She appears to be quite short in stature if her photos, relative to her surroundings, are anything to go by. However, details regarding her actual height and other body measurements are currently not publicly available. We are keeping tabs and will update this information once it is out.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-education></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Education</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sotomayor attended Cardinal Spellman High School in the Bronx. She was on the forensics team and was elected to the student government. Sotomayor graduated as valedictorian in 1972.</p><p>Sotomayor joined Princeton University&nbsp;on a full scholarship,&nbsp;by her own later description gaining admission in part due to her achievements in high school and in part because&nbsp;affirmative action made up for her standardized test scores not being fully comparable to those of other applicants.</p><p>After she received low marks on the first mid-term paper, she sought help, taking more English and writing classes. She also became highly involved with the Puerto Rican groups on campus, including Acción Puertorriqueña and the Third World Center.</p><p>The groups, she said, provided her with an anchor she needed to ground herself in that new and different world. Sotomayor also worked with the university’s discipline committee, where she started developing her legal skills. All of Sotomayor’s hard work paid off when she graduated summa cum laude from Princeton in 1976. She was also awarded the Pyne Prize, which is the highest academic award given to Princeton undergraduates.</p><p>That same year, Sotomayor entered Yale Law School, where she was an editor for the Yale Law Journal. She received her J.D. in 1979, passed the bar in 1980, and immediately began work as an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, serving as a trial lawyer under District Attorney Robert Morgenthau. Sotomayor was responsible for prosecuting robbery, assault, murder, police brutality, and child pornography cases.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-family></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Family</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sotomayor was born as the elder of two children in&nbsp;<span class="LrzXr kno-fv">The Bronx, New York to parents who were migrants from Puerto Rico who relocated to New York City in search of a better life. The two left Puerto Rico separately, met, and married during World War II after her mother served in the Women’s Army Corps.</span></p><p>Her father was Juan Sotomayor (born 1921),&nbsp;from the area of&nbsp;Santurce, San Juan, Puerto Rico,&nbsp;and her mother was Celina Báez (born 1927),&nbsp;an orphan&nbsp;from the neighborhood of Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico’s southwest coast. Her parents worked on a very modest income; her mother worked as a telephone operator&nbsp;and then a&nbsp;practical nurse at a methadone clinic, and her father had a third-grade education, did not speak English, and worked as a tool-and-die worker.</p><p>Sonia grew up with an emotionally distant alcoholic father and mother; she felt closest to her grandmother, who she later said gave her a source of “protection and purpose”. Sonia was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age seven and ever since has given herself insulin shots before she eats, to help manage her blood sugar levels. Her father died of heart problems at age 42, when she was nine years old.</p><p>Her younger brother, Juan Sotomayor (born c. 1957), later became a physician and university professor in the Syracuse, New York, area.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-celina-baez></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Celina Baez</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Her mother was Celina Báez (born 1927),&nbsp;an orphan&nbsp;from the neighborhood of Santa Rosa in Lajas, a rural area on Puerto Rico’s southwest coast.

Sotomayor said that the pressures of her working life were a contributing factor, but not the major factor, in the breakup. Justice Sotomayor says that she and Noonan remained friends after divorce.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-children></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Children</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sonia was once married but did not have children.

However, neither mentioned President Donald Trump, or embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh by name.</p><p>In the current divisive political environment, Kagan said the court needs to be seen as “above the fray” to preserve its legitimacy. Sotomayor agreed, adding that the politicization of legal ideology has hurt the court.</p><p>Both justices said the high court rules unanimously on far more cases than the public realizes. But for more contentious cases, however, Kagan acknowledged that the court tends to be divided in predictable ways.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=sonia-sotomayor-supreme-court></span><span>Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Sotomayor is a judge at the supreme court of the United States of America since August 2009.</p><p>Her colleagues are;</p><ul><li>John G.
