The movie does a conscientious though far from inspired job of illuminating the wider context of Williams' end.&amp;nbsp;Directed by cinematographer Tylor Norwood, this film is of limited use as a biography of the entertainer, and even though the project wasn't meant to fulfill that mandate, it's still frustrating how little insight it&amp;nbsp;gives into Williams' brilliance.</description></item><item><title>The Starling movie review &amp;amp; film summary (2021)</title><link>/the-starling-film-review-2021.html</link><pubDate>Mon, 24 Jun 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/the-starling-film-review-2021.html</guid><description>The truth is that&amp;nbsp;you might cry.
