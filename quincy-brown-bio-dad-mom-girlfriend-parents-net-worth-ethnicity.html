<time>25 Aug 2024, 00:00</time></div></div><p><span>Most of us can only imagine what it is like to be an offspring of entertainment powerhouses.&nbsp;Yes, the benefits would be amazing, but imagine following in your parents’ footsteps – the expectations would be huge in any case.&nbsp;Quincy Brown got his acting talent and great looks from his mother and his musical genes from his father and he’s quite good on the film set, the music stage and the catwalks.&nbsp;Besides the family connection, Brown is one who has literally worked his way to the top of the entertainment industry thanks to hard work.&nbsp;He has an impressive resume and is growing up quickly while continuing in the family tradition.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Quincy Brown’s Bio (Age and Ethnicity)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Brown began his career as a model, actor, singer-songwriter, photographer and director with the full name Quincy Taylor Brown.&nbsp;His mother gave birth to him on June 4, 1991 in New York City.&nbsp;The son of legendary singer Al B. Sure!&nbsp;and late model Kimberly Porter, the actor was named after his godfather, Quincy Jones, a noted music and entertainment lord.&nbsp;He is an American of African American ethnicity.</span></p><p><span>At his younger age, Brown moved often with his family.&nbsp;However, he spent most of his youth in the city of Georgia and later moved to Los Angeles while he was his senior year of high school.&nbsp;He eventually graduated from his high school at Calabasas High School in Calabasas, California.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Parents – father and mother</span></strong></h2><p><span>Quincy Brown’s parents are named KimberlyPorter, popularly known as Kim Porter, and Albert Joseph Brown III, known professionally as Al B. Sure!&nbsp;Kim was born on December 16, 1971 in Columbus, Georgia, USA.&nbsp;She graduated from Columbus High School in 1988 and moved to Atlanta shortly after graduating.&nbsp;Porter started out as a model, later became an actress, playing minor roles in films such as&nbsp;</span><span>Single Women</span><span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</span><span>The Brothers</span><span>&nbsp;and TV series like&nbsp;</span><span>Wicked Wicked Games</span><span></span></p><p><span>Quincy’s father, Al B. Sure!, is the son of a nuclear medicine technician, an accountant who was born on June 4, 1968 in Boston, Massachusetts, USA and grew up in Mount Vernon, New York.&nbsp;He rose to prominence in the entertainment industry as a singer, record producer, songwriter, radio host and record producer.&nbsp;Al B. Sure’s marriage to Kim was as short-lived as can be.&nbsp;The two married in 1989 and divorced the following year.</span></p><p><span>Besides Quincy, his father has two other sons named Albert Brown IV (born October 30, 1986) and Devin Brown.&nbsp;The former is a talented singer who has brought people under the stage name Lil ‘B.&nbsp;Sure entertains, while the latter is an Atlanta-based hip-hop artist and record producer known professionally as Devin LOUD.&nbsp;Al B Surah!&nbsp;Co-wrote and produced a song titled: “Forever My Lady” in honor of his son and Kim Porter.</span></p><p><span>In addition to Brown, Kim Porter has three other children from her relationship with American entrepreneur, songwriter, record producer, rapper, singer and actress Puff Daddy (born Sean John Combs), also known by the stage names Puffy, P. Diddy and Diddy.&nbsp;Combs and Kim first met in a studio while he was an A&R executive at Uptown Records and later began seeing each other in 1994.&nbsp;Their unbroken relationship, which survived until 2007, produced twin girls Jessie James and D’Lila Star (born 2006) and a son named Christian Combs (1998).</span></p><p><span>Shortly after Porter’s divorce from Quincy’s father, rapper Combs adopted and raised Brown as his son — which is why he’s sometimes referred to as Quincy Combs.&nbsp;Diddy and Kim showed the world how much they love Quincy in 2007 when they threw a celebrity-studded party in Atlanta to celebrate his 16th birthday.&nbsp;The event was even featured on MTV’s&nbsp;</span><span>My Super Sweet 16.</span><span>&nbsp;And ever since he caught the eye on the show, his personal life has been a topic of interest to the public.</span></p><p><span>On November 15, 2018, his mother Kim Porter was found dead at her home in Los Angeles.&nbsp;She is said to have died after a cardiac arrest.</span></p><h2><strong><span>who is his girlfriend</span></strong></h2><p><span>Many of the female admirers who would do anything to have Quincy Brown as their husband are genuinely concerned about the hunk’s relationship status.&nbsp;As of now, the multi-hyphenated personality could possibly be unmarried as he hasn’t been in the news about dating a girl in a long time.&nbsp;However, Brwon has been in a few relationships in the past.&nbsp;He is said to have dated American actress Keke Palmer for a year, after which he met British television personality Kelly Osbourne in 2014.&nbsp;In 2015 and later in 2017, he was linked to Kourtney Kardashian, leading to romance rumors.&nbsp;However, neither of them have commented on their relationship status.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Wealth (income and earnings)</span></strong></h2><p><span>Being a member of an aristocratic family and there is no doubt that the 1.88 meter tall star is doing his best to fit into his parents’ shoes.&nbsp;He currently resides in Los Angeles, California and has his own line of watches, Chalk by Quincy, a tech company, as well as a denim collection with Embellish.&nbsp;As of 2018, his net worth is still under scrutiny, although some sources reported that it is worth $600,000.</span></p><p class=postsid
