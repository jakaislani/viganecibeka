Try to feed them within 3 months of their sell-by date.<h2>How often should I change my guinea pigs pellets?</h2>Replace pellets on a daily basis. Guinea pigs often kick bedding material or droppings into their food bowls and stale pellets will have little, if any, vitamin C.<h2>How do you store guinea pig pellets?</h2>Guinea pig pellets shouldn't be stored in the fridge but should be kept in a dry, cool and dark place. Avoid placing them next to a radiator or in direct sunlight. If you're leaving them in the packet they were bought in, make sure it is completely sealed as light will reduce the vitamin C content.<h2>Do Guinea Pigs Really NEED Pellets?</h2><p></p><h2>Do guinea pigs need vegetables every day?</h2>Guinea pigs' need fresh greens and vegetables every day to help them get enough vitamin C (they can't produce it themselves).

Hay trays are topped up twice a day with hay and once a day with fresh grass.<h2>What pellets should guinea pigs avoid?</h2>1/8 cup of pellets per day is suggested to prevent obesity. Avoid mixes with nuts, corn, seeds and fruit. Guinea pigs cannot digest these rich ingredients.<h2>What are guinea pig pellets made of?</h2>Most guinea pig pellets are alfalfa based.

After your guinea pig is about a year old and fully developed (see notes), a timothy based pellet, which provides less calcium, may be a good choice.<h2>Can a guinea pig survive without pellets?</h2>However, pellet food is not needed if you are careful to round out the remainder of the diet.

However, water bowls are a safe alternative if your guinea pig is elderly, injured, or simply dislikes using water bottles.<h2>Should you cover a guinea pig cage at night?</h2>Covering the whole cage at night can create problems and affect your guinea pigs breathing. That means that you should only cover part of their cage at night. This ensures that the cage remains properly ventilated while still letting in some light.<h2>Can guinea pigs drink tap water?</h2>If you drink tap water, that's fine for your guinea pigs.<h2>Can you overfeed a guinea pig?</h2>Overfeeding can be damaging to your guinea pig's digestion tract, and cause obesity. To prevent yourself from overfeeding your guinea pig, all you need to do is serve your guinea pigs the right portioned meals and cut down on unnecessary sugary treats.<h2>How often should guinea pigs be fed?</h2>Feed your guinea pig on a consistent scheduleâ€”twice a day, morning and evening. Because guinea pigs will overeat if given the chance, be sure not to overfeed pelleted food, as it is predominantly carbohydrate and can lead to diarrhea and decreased appetite.<h2>How long can guinea pigs go without food?</h2>So, how long can guinea pigs go without food and water? Healthy guinea pigs shouldn't go over 8 hours without food. They won't starve in this time, but they can develop potentially fatal GI stasis or other health issues.

Vitamin C (see below) should be given each day. Hay should be offered free-choice throughout the day.<h2>Are grain free pellets better for guinea pigs?</h2>Kind to teeth with no added sugars or artificial colours, Selective Naturals Grain Free is blended with natural linseed, to help promote clear skin and a glossy coat. It helps to keep guinea pigs as healthy on the outside as they are on the inside.
