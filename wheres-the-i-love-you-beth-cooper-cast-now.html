The classic teen romp had a tight but talented cast that elevated the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Chris Columbus</a> vehicle from just another high school film into a sleeper hit, almost rivaling the impact of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Superbad</a> which had come out a couple of years earlier to fill the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">American Pie</a>-shaped void in popular culture.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=533 data-current-count=533 data-injectable=true>While the cast was a combination of up-and-coming names and established actors, in the decade plus since the film’s release its stars have gone on to have successful careers, with some working consistently while others have retreated a little more into the shadows. If you were a geek in 2009 who was hoping to get the girl (or boy) and found solace in I Love You, Beth Cooper, or if you just enjoyed the film and want to know what happened to the cast, then read ahead to find out where the I Love You Beth Cooper cast is now.</p><h2 id=h-hayden-panettiere-beth-cooper data-injectable=false>Hayden Panettiere – Beth Cooper</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/hayden.jpg><p data-characters=436 data-current-count=736 data-injectable=true>When I Love You, Beth Cooper was released, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Hayden Panettiere</a> wasn’t just the star of the movie but by far the hottest name in the cast. After a successful child acting career that included roles in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ally McBeal</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Malcolm in the Middle</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Remember the Titans</a>, and while trying to push her fledgeling musical career off the ground, she was cast as Claire Bennet in the NBC series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heroes</a>, launching her profile into the stratosphere.</p><p data-characters=823 data-current-count=823 data-injectable=true>After her turn as the popular yet complex Beth she worked consistently for a few years, delivering excellent performances in the television series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nashville</a> and being one of the only bright spots in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Scream 4</a>. However, Panettiere was desperate to show off her range, telling Contactmusic “If I don’t get out of this category [cheerleader] pretty quickly, it will just get more and more difficult to be seen as anything besides a cheerleader.” While Nashville gave her a chance to display her acting talents, jobs in other productions weren’t coming as easily, although she did take on the controversial role of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Amanda Knox </a>in the film of the same name. During this time she also began an on-again, off-again relationship with former heavyweight boxer Wladimir Klitschko, with whom she has a daughter.</p><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=522 data-injectable=true>Panettiere has been open about her mental health struggles, with the biggest example of this being a candid interview she did with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Morning America</a> about suffering from post-partum depression after the birth of her daughter. This all culminated in a break from acting and the limelight in general. However, fans will be happy to know that she’s recently appeared in the newest film in the Scream franchise, and she continues to do important activism work around women’s mental health and domestic violence.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Paul Rust – Dennis Cooverman</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/paul-rust-1.jpg><p data-characters=503 data-current-count=803 data-injectable=true>While Panettiere was already an established star by the time I Love You, Beth Cooper was released, her geeky co-star Paul Rust was still making a name for himself in Hollywood and beyond. Prior to the film he’d had small roles in massive hits like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Semi-Pro</a> and Inglorious Basterds, but his turn as valedictorian Dennis Cooverman was his first chance at being a leading man in a major film – and he grasped it with both hands, delivering a humorous yet real performance as the lovestruck Dennis.</p><p data-characters=721 data-current-count=721 data-injectable=true>Rust has since garnered a fair amount of acclaim by being involved in several well-received productions, including writing and starring in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Judd Apatow</a>-produced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Love</a> on Netflix (he wrote the show alongside his wife, fellow comedy writer Lesley Arfin). However, for the most part he’s gone back to his comedy roots, writing for series like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Arrested Development</a> and continuing to perform improv with the Upright Citizens Brigade, which has produced a slew of incredible comedic actors like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Aubrey Plaza</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ben Schwartz</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Glover</a>. He also had several smaller roles in film and television, and co-wrote and acted in Pee-wee’s Big Holiday, so it’s been a successful few years for the comedic actor.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Jack Carpenter – Rich Munsch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/jack-carpenter.jpg><p data-characters=522 data-current-count=822 data-injectable=true>When he took on the role of sexually confused Rich Munsch, Jack Carpenter wasn’t exactly a big name, but with this hilarious performance his acting career since has been more consistent than explosive in the past few years. In the time since I Love You, Beth Cooper, Jack has had parts in shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Law and Order</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Good Wife</a>, the latter of which gave him a five-episode run. His biggest role since the film was in the 2016 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gilmore Girls</a> mini-series, which took viewers back to Stars Hollow for one last time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Lauren Storm – Treece</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lauren-Storm.jpg><p data-characters=361 data-current-count=661 data-injectable=true>Lauren Storm had a whole host of excellent credits to her name as a child actor before taking on the role of Beth’s friend Treece in I Love You Beth Cooper. Another Malcolm in the Middle alum, she’d also had roles in shows like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">24</a> and CSI: Miami by the time she was cast in the film, as well as co-starring in Whore with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Megan Fox</a> the previous year.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>However, since I Love You, Beth Cooper Lauren seems to be focusing more on being an acting coach and supporting causes she feels are closest to her heart, raising money for organizations like the Make a Wish Foundation. Her last acting gig was in 2017.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Lauren London – Cammy</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Lauren-London.jpg><p data-characters=665 data-current-count=665 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Lauren London</a> was already one of the most famous cast members of I Love You, Beth Cooper thanks to her appearances in music videos with superstars like <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Snoop Dogg</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ludacris</a>, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Pharrell Williams</a>, as well as a big role in the film ATL and appearances in shows like 90210 and Everybody Hates Chris. After appearing as Beth’s popular friend Cammy she’s been a mainstay on both the big and small screen, having scored parts in multiple films and television shows, as well as landing the starring role in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">CW</a> show <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game</a>. Recently, she starred alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jonah Hill</a> in the Netflix film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">You People</a>, which has been one of the early streaming hits of 2023.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Shawn Roberts – Kevin</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Shawn-Roberts.jpg><p data-characters=572 data-current-count=872 data-injectable=true>The villain of I Love You, Beth Cooper and also one of the funniest performers in it, Shawn Roberts probably has the longest resume of the cast, with dozens of credits to his name across film and television. Before taking on the role of Beth’s soldier boyfriend in the film, the Canadian actor had worked on tons of iconic children’s and teen television shows, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Goosebumps</a>, Degrassi: The Next Generation, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Flash Gordon</a>. His big screen roles were just as impressive too, having worked on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Cheaper by the Dozen 2</a>, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jumper</a>, and even the 2000 <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">X-Men</a> film.</p><p data-characters=344 data-current-count=344 data-injectable=false>After playing meathead Kevin, Roberts went on to carve a bit of a niche out for himself in the zombie film world, with roles in the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Resident Evil</a> franchise and a slew of other films about our undead friends. He’s been steadily working in television as well, with his most recent appearance being on the CBC show Murdoch Mysteries in 2022.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Alan Ruck – Mr. C</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Alan-Ruck.jpg><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=392 data-injectable=false>While Hayden Panattiere was the hottest name in I Love You, Beth Cooper, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Ruck</a> had undoubtedly been in the most popular film out of all the cast, having played Cameron in the iconic<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</a>. Between that unforgettable role and becoming the slightly inappropriate, albeit loving, dad in I Love You, Beth Cooper, he was also in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Speed</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twister</a> – quite the resume!</p><p data-characters=538 data-current-count=930 data-injectable=true>Since the 2009 teen comedy Ruck has worked on a number of highly successful films and television shows, but his best, most popular, and most recent role is as Connor Roy on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HBO’</a>s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Succession</a>. His portrayal of the slightly dim yet incredibly entitled eldest child of the Roy clan has led to praise from viewers and critics, while also giving him the chance to show off a surprising range. The eagerly anticipated fourth season of Succession will be out in March this year, so we’ll be seeing Ruck back on our screens in no time.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Marie Avgeropoulos – Valli Wooley</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Valli-ILYBC.png><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Avgeropoulos was practically an acting newbie when she landed the role of vain, rich Valli in I Love You, Beth Cooper. Prior to the 2009 comedy, she’d only acted in commercials in her native Canada, a job she only got after going to an open casting with a friend, but since the film’s success she’s been getting consistent work in film and television on both sides of the border.</p><p data-characters=478 data-current-count=478 data-injectable=false>In 2015, after a few bit-part roles in television in the U.S. and Canada (and dating <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twilight</a> star Taylor Lautner), she was given a leading role in the post-apocalyptic CW series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The 100</a>. The series ran for exactly 100 episodes and Avgeropoulos appeared in 95 as the fiercely independent Octavia. Since the show was cancelled in 2020 she hasn’t worked much, although is slated to appear in the John Kennedy Toole biopic Butterfly in the Typewriter alongside <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Offerman</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqbHRnqpmrJiaeqp5y6itnmWppMJursStn2abn6S9pr6MnJisrF2jvLh7</p><h4><i class="fas fa-share-alt" aria-hidden=true></i>&nbsp;Share!</h4><ul class=share-buttons><li><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwheres-the-i-love-you-beth-cooper-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Facebook</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?source=%2fwheres-the-i-love-you-beth-cooper-cast-now.html" target=_blank title=Tweet><i class="fab fa-twitter" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Tweet</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="https://plus.google.com/share?url=%2fwheres-the-i-love-you-beth-cooper-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Share on Google+"><i class="fab fa-google-plus" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Share on Google+</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.tumblr.com/share?v=3&u=%2fwheres-the-i-love-you-beth-cooper-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Post to Tumblr"><i class="fab fa-tumblr" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Post to Tumblr</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwheres-the-i-love-you-beth-cooper-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Pin it"><i class="fab fa-pinterest-p" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Pin it</span></a></li>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<li><a href="http://www.reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwheres-the-i-love-you-beth-cooper-cast-now.html" target=_blank title="Submit to Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit-alien" aria-hidden=true></i><span class=sr-only>Submit to Reddit</span></a></li></ul><style>ul.share-buttons{list-style:none;padding:0}ul.share-buttons li{display:inline}ul.share-buttons .sr-only{position:absolute;clip:rect(1px 1px 1px 1px);clip:rect(1px,1px,1px,1px);padding:0;border:0;height:1px;width:1px;overflow:hidden}</style><div class="prev-next-post pure-g"><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:left><a href=./full-force-net-worth-278474.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-left"></i></a></div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=prev><a href=./full-force-net-worth-278474.html>Full Force Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-2-24>&nbsp;</div><div class=pure-u-10-24><nav class=next><a href=./tom-arnold-net-worth-2024.html>Tom Arnold Net Worth 2024</a></nav></div><div class=pure-u-1-24 style=text-align:right><a href=./tom-arnold-net-worth-2024.html><i class="fa fa-chevron-right"></i></a></div></div></div></div></div><script src=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/blackburn/js/ui.js></script>
